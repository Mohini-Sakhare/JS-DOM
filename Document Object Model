## HTML DOM (Document Object Model) :-
The HTML DOM (Document Object Model) is a structured representation of a web page that allows developers to access, modify, and control its content and structure using JavaScript. 
It powers most dynamic website interactions, enabling features like real-time updates, form validation, and interactive user interfaces.

The HTML Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree structure, where each HTML tag becomes a node in the hierarchy.
At the top, the <html> tag is the root element, containing both <head> and<body> as child elements.
These in turn have their own children, such as <title>, <div>, and nested elements like <h1>, <p>,<ul>, and<li>.
Elements that contain other elements are labeled as container elements, while elements that do not are simply child elements.
This hierarchy allows developers to navigate and manipulate web page content using JavaScript by traversing from parent to child and vice versa.

## What Does the HTML DOM Look Like?
Imagine your webpage as a tree:

The document is the root.
HTML tags like <html>, <head>, and <body> are branches.
Attributes, text, and other elements are the leaves.

## Why is DOM Required?
The DOM is essential because:

1.Dynamic Content Updates:
Without reloading the page, the DOM allows content updates (e.g., form validation, AJAX responses).
2.User Interaction: 
It makes your webpage interactive (e.g., responding to button clicks, form submissions).
3.Flexibility: 
Developers can add, modify, or remove elements and styles in real-time.
4.Cross-Platform Compatibility: 
It provides a standard way for scripts to interact with web documents, ensuring browser compatibility.
